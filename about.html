	Covid-19 has changed many lives. More and more people are working from home and studying from home through the internet. Social medias and other applications have become the norm. I decided to take computer engineering as I found it evolving everyday. It is interesting to note computers are here to stay. I am a confident young man who has a strong interest in aeroplanes. Besides that, I have an interest in music and I can play the piano. I am currently taking the grade 8 piano exam. I strongly believe that I possess good leadership qualities and communication skills since young as I have been assigned with various leadership roles through my schooling years. Over the years, I grew to become a better leader and I believe I have the ability and maturity to guide my peers. Also, I am able to speak in 3 languages namely English, Tamil and Malayalam.

				<p style = "color:white;position: relative; right: 500px"> It is a premium program that allows scope for engineering academics. Through this program, I will be able to gain new skills and create new innovations for the world to enjoy. It will not be a routine work and one can take pride in building a better place for the world. Every problem in engineering is a challenge which gives one to grow out from it. Hence, I take this opportunity to join this program to improve myself to be a better person. </p>
